The provided images are from the internet, we collected them to prove that our model works with any type of MRI image

** NOTE: OUR MODEL HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THESE IMAGES YET. **



1) SHEBA_tal_Ha-Shomer.jpg: an image taken from [1] which they didn't specify that this
brain from the MRI scan contains a tumor.

2) men_z-axis_{1,2,3}.jpg: three images of type meningioma for different positions on the z-axis (top to bottom)
which translates to differing contrast [2]

3) casersports_bmj.jpg: an image from BMJ journals (casersports) - they specified that its
 "Acute brainstem haemorrhage as a presenting feature of high-grade glioma" in their article [3]

4) low_quality.jpg: a random image from Google search (images) which is in low quality
